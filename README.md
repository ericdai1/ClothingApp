Welcome to Banana Search!

An app that allows a user to easily upload an image of any type of clothing they would like, and get 
relevant results regarding the most similar types of clothing from online shopping stores (such as 
Banana Republic) that also fit their filter conditions. This utilizes Vector Search, MongoDB, streamlit,
webscraping, and several other technologies to create a simple application for the purporse of searching
for clothes you want! 

Enjoy your time here, and new updates will be added in the future if development continues.
